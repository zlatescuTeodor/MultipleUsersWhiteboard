# MultipleUsersWhiteboard
This is the source code for a whiteboard server that will connect multiple clients, for my final project in my 3rd year's first semester 2019.

To run the code, first launch the server by running /src/server/Server.java. Then run /src/client/Client.java to launch an instance of the whiteboard client. To collaborate on a board, run another instance of the client and connect to the same board. In real time, all updates will propagate across all board clients.

To connect to a whiteboard server, change the host and port parameters in the board class.
